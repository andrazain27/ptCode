# Hello, my name is Darwish and this is my repository for the subject I learn in the university

## First and foremost I was using C as my programming language since the university intend to teach the student about the concept of programming language.











To be honest, I'm still new to programming. My official journey in programming starts in September 2019 when I went to university for my degree. My unofficial journey however, starts at the end of 2017 when I finish my secondary school. I learned programming through videos on the internet. My first piece of code is a python code I learnt from youtube to make a calculator and I did it. However, I can't find the code anywhere. It looks like I need to make it again from the beginning.
